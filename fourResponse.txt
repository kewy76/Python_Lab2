When we use the k nearest neighbor algorithm, the value we assign to k is very important.

When k is larger, the accuracy of the algorithm is higher.  This is due to the fact that there are more centroids and, therefore,
more clusters.  More clusters means that each point gets, if not the best possible fit, a very good, very accurate fit (even if it is not
perfect.)  Meanwhile, fewer centroids lead to fewer clusters, which lead to points being assigned to inaccurate clusters because there
is nothing better to put them in.
